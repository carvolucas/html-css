            <h2>Ascend to the Peak of a Haunted Kingdom</h2>
            <h3>Captured and Taken to a Distant Land</h3>
            <p>
                Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world.
            </p>
            <p>
                She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Lethal Acrobatic Action</h3>
            <p>
                Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She'll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom's challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights - Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!
            </p>

            <h3>Beauty and Wonder in a Haunted World</h3>
            <p>
                The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire,  and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score.
            </p>
            <p>
                In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.
